# SciPy 2024 Tutorial Submissions: GPU image analysis and Deep Learning using the Image.sc ecosystem. 

A short course exploring GPU image analysis and deep learning using tools, techniques and inspiration from Image.sc.  Image.sc is a discussion forum for scientific imaging with over 60 scientific partners, including CLIJ, Napari and Stardist.  In this tutorial we will use those toolkits, in addition to Cupy and Pytorch to tackle difficult image segmentation and restoration problems.  The course is a condensed and modified version of a 2.5 day [GPU image-analysis course](https://github.com/BiAPoL/PoL-BioImage-Analysis-TS-GPU-Accelerated-Image-Analysis/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file) held at TU Dresden - Physics of Life in August 2023.   This course consists of 4 main sections.

1.  Classical image processing on the GPU using Clij, CLesperanto and Cupy
2.  Convolution and Deconvolution on the GPU.
3.  Pixel Classification using Machine Learning 
4.  Deep Learning using Stardist and PyTorch.

Throughout the course we will use the Napari Viewer to explore, compare and annotate images.  We plan to use the same image set throughout each section and demonstrate, with real examples how analysis results evolve as we move from classical image processing, to pixel classification to deep learning.
